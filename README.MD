# Heart Disease Binary Classifier

This repository showcases the development and evaluation of a binary classifier for predicting heart disease using a comprehensive heart disease dataset. Leveraging the power of Python and Scikit-learn, the project encompasses various stages of machine learning, including data preprocessing, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and model evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:** The dataset undergoes meticulous preprocessing and cleaning to ensure data integrity and enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Comprehensive analysis and visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into the dataset, aiding in better understanding and feature selection.

- **Binary Classification Model:** The core focus lies in building a robust binary classifier capable of predicting the presence or absence of heart disease. Two prominent algorithms, namely Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors, are implemented for comparative evaluation.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The model's performance is fine-tuned through hyperparameter tuning, optimizing its parameters for enhanced predictive accuracy.

- **Cross-Validation and Grid Search:** Rigorous cross-validation techniques, coupled with grid search, are employed to ensure the model's generalizability and robustness across different subsets of the dataset.
